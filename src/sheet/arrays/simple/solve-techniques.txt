# Hello world : Use simple print statement to print the message on the console.

# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock 1:
                  You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

                  You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

                  Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
        Solution: Use simple iteration: First check if current price is less than minimum price, so current price becomes min price'
                  Second store the value of max profit as max of (max, current_price - min_price)

# Maximum SubArray: Find the sum of the largest Sub Array:
        Solution: Keep calculating the price of the array elements till it is greater than 0.
                    Also keep updating maxSum var.
                    If sum is less than 0 update sum to 0.

# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock 2:
                  You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

                  On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

                  Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
        Solution: If prices of next day is greater than previous day calculate the price difference and add it to the sum.

# Majority element: Find Majority element.
        Solution: Keep count variable - if curr elem == me, count++ or count--. If count = 0, update the ME to elem.

# Remove Duplicates from a sorted Array:
                   Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
                   Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
                   Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

                   Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
        Solution: Keep two pointers to check the next unique element. Put the next unique element in current position which has duplicate element

# Container With Most Water:
                You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

                Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

                Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
        Solution:
