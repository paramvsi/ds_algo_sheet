Q: Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.
Solution:
Approach 1: Brute force: Find the sum of each subarray and then check if its equal to k.
            T C: O(n3) as Sum of each subarrays takes n3 time.
Approach 2: Using Cumulative Sum: For each start point takes the sum till end and check if sum[start] - sum[end] = k
            T C: O(n2)
Approach 3: Using Hashmap
            If the cumulative sum(represented by sum[i]sum[i] for sum up to ith index) up to two indices is the same,
            the sum of the elements lying in between those indices is zero.
            Extending the same thought further, if the cumulative sum up to two indices, say i and j is at a difference of k,
            i.e. if sum[i] - sum[j] = k, the sum of elements lying between indices i and j is k.
            Hence, we store the Hashmap for all the cumulative sum possible for all ith index and check if sum - k exist for any key. If exist we increase the count by value of the key.
            T C: O(n), and S C: O(n).
